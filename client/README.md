 ## Description
 * The HubbyHelper App helps forgetful husbands/partners by reminding them to buy gifts/do nice things for their significant other.

 ## Concept / Motivation
 * The concept for this app started with: "It's not that I don't have the time or money, I just *forget*!"
 * The purchasing of gifts in my own relationship is horredously skewed against me, so I designed this app to help me fix that skew, and maybe help a few others along the way.

 ## Tech/Framework
 * Powered by React

 ## Features - All planned at this stage
 * Customizable reminders sent to your Google calender, with reminders
 * Selection of gifts, with attachable notes on things like: sizes, colour preference and DO NOT GET 'X'
 * Directions to nearest, or link to online, stores
 * Spontaneous feature, where a user selects a price range, and a random gift is selected for them

 ## Contributing 
 * At the moment this is a solo project, but I hope to be able to open up to contributions in future.
