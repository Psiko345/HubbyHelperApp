 ## Description
 * The HubbyHelper App helps forgetful husbands/partners by reminding them to buy gifts/do nice things for their significant other.

 ## Concept/Motivation
 * The concept for this app started with the sentence: "It's not that I don't have the time or money, I just *forget*!"
 * The purchasing of gifts in my own relationship is horredously skewed against me, so I designed this app to help me fix that skew, and maybe help a few others along the way.

 ## Features
 * Random gift generation with selectable categories & budget ranges
 * Ability to save gifts to a users profile
 * User accounts are automatically created by logging in with Google

 ## Scope of Future Development
 * Customizable reminders sent to your Google calender, with reminders
 * Attachable notes to specific gifts like: sizes, colour preference or " DO NOT GET 'X' "
 * Directions to nearest, or link to online, stores
 * Direct online purchasing of the gift
